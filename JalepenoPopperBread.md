From our friend Beth

Mix a block of room temp cream cheese with a 4 oz can of diced jalape√±os, 1/4 cup of mayo, and about 4 oz each of shredded cheddar and Monterey jack. This will be enough for two loaves the size I made for you guys, so you can halve it if you like, or use the leftovers as dip.
For the bread, get a premade loaf of crusty type bread and cut it in a cross-hatch pattern most of the way through (leave it connected at the bottom). Then, stuff the cheese mixture in every crack. This will be messy and look awful, but don't worry. It always seems to turn out okay in the end. Bake it at 375 for 20-25, or until it's bubbly and brown on top. I sometimes broil it at the end if it's cooked, but not quite brown. Let it cool for just a bit before you let people touch it. The cheese can me lava hot if you're not careful.
I usually use the tuscan loaves, I think, from Kroger. But you could probably use just about anything that would be chewy rather than soft.
