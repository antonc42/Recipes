Ingredients

Dough (Very slightly adapted from Fearless Homemaker to make a single crust without herbs)

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 tsp instant yeast
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 cup warm water

Pizza

* 4 oz premium white chocolate

Raspberry Swirl (you will have leftover)

* 3/4 cup raspberries fresh or frozen
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 1 1/2 Tbsp water

Cream Cheese Sauce

* 12 oz cream cheese 1 & 1/2 package
* 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Streusel

* 1/4 cup + 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp cold butter


Instructions

* Preheat oven to 500F

Dough

1. In large bowl or KitchenAid combine flour, yeast and salt.
1. Stir in water, stirring until mostly combined and then switch to using your hands to combine until the dough is sticky enough to form a ball.
1. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead about 5 minutes (until elastic), add additional flour 1 Tbsp at a time if needed (if dough is too sticky and sticks to your hands)
1. Roll dough out into 12" circle and transfer to pizza pan. Fold over edges to form a thin crust.
1. Finely chop white chocolate and sprinkle over pizza dough.

Raspberry Swirl

1. Prepare raspberry swirl by combining raspberries, sugar and water in a small saucepan over medium-high heat.
1. Using a spoon, press and mash the raspberries, stirring constantly for 5-7 minutes.
1. Pour through fine mesh strainer into bowl and dispose of the seeds and solid remnants. Allow raspberry liquid to cool to room temperature.

Cream Cheese Sauce

1. In medium, microwave-safe bowl, heat the cream cheese at 10-second intervals until it is mostly melted and easy to stir.
1. Stir in sugar and vanilla and stir well.
1. Pour cream cheese sauce over the white chocolate on the pizza dough (it is OK if the white chocolate sticks to the sauce a little while you are spreading it over the dough, just try to keep it evenly distributed over the base).
1. Ladle spoonfuls of raspberry sauce over the cream cheese sauce (NOTE: you will not use all of the raspberry sauce and you do not want to overwhelm the cream cheese sauce. I use about 2-3 Tbsp) and use a knife to swirl through the cream cheese mixture.

Streusel

1. In small bowl, combine flour, sugars and butter.
1. Cut in butter until mixture is crumblike and sprinkle over the pizza.
1. Bake on 500F for 7-9 minutes, allow to cool at least 5 minutes before cutting and serving.
