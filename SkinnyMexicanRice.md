Ingredients

    1 onion small, diced
    1/4 cup water plus more as needed
    2 garlic cloves minced
    1 cup long-grain rice (recommend Uncle Ben's Long Grain Brown Rice - not the quick or instant kind)
    1 teaspoon cumin
    1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt
    1/2 cup cilantro freshly chopped
    14 1/2 ounces petit diced tomatoes can
    4 ounces diced green chiles can, optional
    2 cups vegetable broth or chicken broth, low-sodium

Instructions

1. In a large skillet or saucepan add water and diced onion.
1. Turn to medium-low heat and saute onion until tender, about 5 minutes.
1. Add more water as it evaporates.
1. Add garlic and continue to saute one additional minute.
1. Add remaining ingredients, cover, reduce heat, and simmer on low for approximately 45 minutes or until rice has soaked up the liquid and is tender.
1. If rice needs more liquid, add 1/4 cup as needed, or until rice is tender.
1. Remove from heat, leave covered and allow to set 10 minutes before serving.

Notes

The time it takes to cook the rice will depend on the brand. Some brands take 35 minutes, while others take up to an hour. We prefer Uncle Ben's Long Grain Rice because it is tender in approximately 35-45 minutes.
