# Cranberry/Orange/White Chocolate Chip Cookies

# Description

A variation on Chocolate Chip cookies based on [Alton Brown's Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe](http://altonbrown.com/the-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe/). My wife dislikes choclate chip cookies so I never got to make them. One day we had some cranberry orange white chocolate cookies from a store and that inspired us to create this recipe.

## Notes

* Make sure to use actual white chcolate chips (containing cocoa butter), not just "white baking chips" which are basically just sugar.
* If you cannot find white chocolate chips, you may be able to buy white chocolate bars or candy and chop them up.
* When grating the orange zest, the finer the grater, the better.
* Chilling the dough for at least an hour is highly recommended. Overnight is even better. This will keep the cookies from spreading out too thinly while baking.
* Parchment paper is highly recommended to keep the cookies from sticking to the pan.
* Even portioning and nicely round cookies can be achieved with a disher, ice cream scoop, or melon baller.
