Recipe by Tessa
Ingredients
For the dough:

    1 cup plus 2 tablespoons warm water
    1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
    2 tablespoons granulated sugar
    3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
    1 3/4 teaspoons salt
    16 ounces (about 3 1/3 to 3 1/2 cups) bread flour

For the topping:

    2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
    1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
    1/4 teaspoon garlic powder

Directions

1. In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the water, yeast, sugar, and butter. Add in the salt. Attach the dough hook to the mixer and begin to gradually add the flour on low speed. Increase speed to medium and knead the dough for about 7 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.
2. Remove the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
3. Divide the dough into 12 (2 ounce) portions. Roll each piece of dough into a 7-inch log. Place the dough logs on nonstick baking mat or parchment-lined baking sheets, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from oven and immediately brush with melted butter. Combine the salt and garlic powder and sprinkle evenly over breadsticks. Serve warm.
