# Sloppy Joes

## Description

This is a very basic and easy Sloppy Joe recipie. I believe it is based on this [Sloppy Joes II](http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/24264/sloppy-joes-ii/?mxt=t06rda) recipe.

## Notes

* The choice of bread/bun to eat this on is yours, but we recommend a nice onion bun.
* We like the extra sloppiness of this recipe, but if you want a drier result use less ketchup and mustard.
