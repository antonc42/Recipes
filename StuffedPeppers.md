Cook 3/4 a cup of rice. Cut 3 peppers in half (getting rid of stems, seeds, and ribs) and put them on an oiled baking dish/pan. Season with salt and pepper and bake at 375Â° for 15-20 minutes. While the peppers cook/cool, mix together cooked rice, 4 oz. softened cream cheese, 1 can of black beans (drained and rinsed), 1 can Rotel tomatoes (NOT drained), salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano. Taste for seasoning. When peppers are cool enough to handle, fill with rice mixture and top with shredded cheddar cheese. Bake again for about 30 minutes, or until peppers are soft (fork test) and cheese is browned. Serve with salsa and sour cream.
