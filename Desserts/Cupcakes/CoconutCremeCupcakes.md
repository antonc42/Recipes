# Coconut crème cupcakes

## Description
Delicious coconut crème filled cupcakes with cream cheese icing. Based on this recipe: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/honor-coconut-cake-with-coconut-creme-filling-and-cream-cheese-buttercream-recipe-2102634.

## Notes

* When filling the cupcake liners, fill to &frac23; full for larger cupcakes.
* The toasted coconut topping is overrated. It doesn't add much to the flavor, just the appearance.

### Ingredients

|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Sweetened, shredded coconut | 7 oz | 196 g
| Sugar | 2 cups | 475 ml |

### Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 350 &deg;F.
1. Line a muffin pan with 24 regular-size cupcake liners.
1. Spread the shredded coconut on a baking sheet and lightly toast in the oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.
1. Remove and cool.
1. Mix the sugar, all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder and salt.
1. On low speed, add the butter in small chunks.
1. Then add the eggs one at a time, followed by the egg whites.
1. In a small bowl, combine the milk and coconut extract.
1. Add the mixture to the mixing bowl and mix until combined.
1. Fill the cupcake liners approximately half full with batter.
1. Bake until the cupcakes are set and a toothpick is removed cleanly, 20 to 25 minutes. They may appear still pale, but golden brown around the edges. Tap the tops to test for firmness.
