# Pie Crust

## Notes
*   How long to bake the crust by itself depends on how long the pie will have to bake.
    * If it is a cream pie that only bakes for 30 minutes, the crust should be baked longer.
    * If it is a fruit pie that bakes for 50-60 minutes, the crust should be baked shorter.
*   If the final pie is baked for a long time, you may want to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil to prevent it from burning.

## Ingredients
|Ingredients | US    |Metric |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| Butter-Flavored Shortening | 1c |  |
| Flour | 2 &frac12; c |  |
| Salt | &frac12; tsp |  |
| Egg | 1 |  |
| Ice water | &frac12; c |  |
| Apple cider vinegar | 1 Tbsp |  |

## Preparation
1.  Stir flour and salt together.
2.  Cut shortening into flour mix with a pastry cutter until crumbly and chunky.
3.  In another bowl, beat egg and cold water.
4.  Add apple cider vinegar into egg and water and mix.
5.  Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and lightly fold together.
6.  Let it sit for a few minutes to let the water absorb.
7.  Using your hands, mix and form into a dough.
8.  If still too dry, add a little bit more water, but not too much so it becomes sticky.
9.  Split the dough in half, shape into round discs, wrap in plastic.
10. Refridgerate for at least an hour. If hurried, put in the freezer for a half hour.
11. Preheat the oven to 425&deg;.
12. Lay out a sheet of parchment or wax paper and flour the top.
13. Roll out dough until it overlaps the size of the pie pan by at least an inch.
14. Lay the pie plate upside down on the dough.
15. Using the parchment or wax paper, flip the dough over into the pie pan.
16. Gently push the dough down to mold to the pie pan.
17. Use a knife to cut the dough along the outside of the pie pan, using the edge as a guide.
18. Pinch the edges of the dough to make a ridge around the outside. If desired, use your fingers to crimp the edges into a wavy shape.
19. Put a piece of parchment paper or alumnium foil over the dough in the pan.
20. Use pie weights (or dry rice or dry beans) to weigh down the bottom so it doesn't bubble.
21. Bake in the oven for 10-20 minutes until the edge is barely browned.
