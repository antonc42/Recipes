Yield: serves 12

Prep Time: 30 minutes

Cook Time:

Total Time: 5 hours (includes cooling)
Ingredients:

    2 and 1/2 cups (312g) all-purpose flour
    2 teaspoons baking powder
    1 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1 and 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1 teaspoon ground ginger
    1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
    1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
    1 cup canola (240ml) or vegetable oil
    1 and 3/4 cup (350g) packed dark brown sugar
    1 cup (180g) unsweetened applesauce
    4 large eggs
    2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
    1 cup grated apple (or grated carrot/zucchini)
    optional: 1 Tablespoon molasses

Cream Cheese Frosting

    8 ounces (224g) full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature
    1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
    3 cups (360g) confectioners' sugar, plus an extra 1/4 cup if needed
    1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
    1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:

    Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and grease a 9x13 inch pan. I always use this glass pan.
    Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and other spices together in a large bowl. Set aside.
    Whisk the oil, brown sugar, applesauce, eggs, vanilla extract, and molasses (if using) together in a medium bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Fold in the grated apple until combined.
    Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 45-50 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If you find the top of the cake is browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with aluminum foil.
    Remove the cake from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely. After about 45 minutes, I usually place it in the refrigerator to speed things up.
    Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on high speed until smooth and creamy. Add 3 confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then switch to high speed and beat for 2 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add the extra 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar (I add it). Spread the frosting on the cooled cake. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before serving. This helps sets the frosting and makes cutting easier.
    Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.
