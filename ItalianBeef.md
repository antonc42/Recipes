# Italian Beef

## Description

This easy Italian beef recipe can be put in a slow cooker all day or overnight. Credit for this goes to my wife's mother.

## Notes

* Pepperoncinis can be whole or sliced. If whole, they are easier to pick out.
* The bread or bun used should be a drier variety like Italian or French bread. The juice will soften it up. Softer breads may just disentegrate.
