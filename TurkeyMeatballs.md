# Turkey Meatballs

Leaner than beef, these Turkey Meatballs are healthy, packed with flavor, and incredibly moist on the inside. A combination of fresh and dried herbs give these meatballs an Italian flare while also providing a balance of flavors. Good and good for you, these meatballs freeze beautifully and can be reheated in no time. To sauce or not to sauce, I leave that up to you!

## Ingredients  
2 pounds ground turkey 93% lean  
1 cup bread crumbs or panko or rolled oats  
2/3 cup onion minced  
1/2 cup fresh parsley minced  
2 large eggs  
3 cloves garlic minced  
2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce  
1/2 teaspoon dried basil  
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano  
Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
1/4 cup olive oil  


## Instructions  
### To make the meatballs:  
In a large bowl, combine ground turkey, bread crumbs, onion, parsley, eggs, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, basil, oregano, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. 

Using a strong spatula or your hands (I like to wear latex gloves), mix well. Shape the mixture into 1-inch balls (you should have around 48 total).

### To bake the meatballs:  
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup. Coat a wire rack with nonstick spray and set on prepared baking sheet.

Arrange meatballs on rack, brush with oil, and bake until browned with crispy edges, about 15 to 20 minutes (an internal thermometer should read 155 degrees for 15 seconds).

### To fry the meatballs:  
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the meatballs in batches until browned on all sides and the meatballs are cooked, about 5 to 7 minutes per batch (an internal thermometer should read 155 degrees for 15 seconds). Add more oil between batches if the skillet looks dry.

### To freeze the meatballs:  
Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet, not touching. Freeze until solid, about 1 hour, then transfer to a freezer-safe container and store up to 1 month.
